## Docker
Make sure docker is running.
Run `docker compose up --build`
Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ to check that the app is running locally

__ Note: The docker setup supports a container for a postgres database, that's not a core feature, but leaving that stubbed is a path of less resistance, and will make supporting user accounts easier later __
